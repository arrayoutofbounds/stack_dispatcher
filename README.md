# stack_dispatcher

This is a stack dispatcher that allocates processes. This is a very basic example. It is in python.

Stack dispatcher is part of the process scheduler. It allocates processes to the CPUs. In this case, the 
dispatcher is a stack. However, the top2 processes can run to simulate a little more realistsic environment.
